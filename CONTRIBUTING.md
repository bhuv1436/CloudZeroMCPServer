## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (we use ESLint and Prettier)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Git Commit Messages

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(tools): add pagination support to billing costs`
- `fix(client): handle network timeout errors gracefully`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` types (use `unknown` if necessary)
- Use proper error handling with typed exceptions

### Testing Guidelines

- Test files should be named `*.test.ts`
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update API documentation for new tools
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update CHANGELOG.md for release notes

## Security

- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Report security issues privately to maintainers
- Follow security best practices for API clients
